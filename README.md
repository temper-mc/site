## License

FerrumC was licensed under the MIT License, but Temper has moved to the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0) to
better align with our values of open source and community involvement. The GPL-3.0 is a copyleft license that requires
any derivative works to also be licensed under the same terms, which we believe will help to ensure that Temper remains
free and open for everyone to use and contribute to.

Due to this, commits to FerrumC and prior to 14/02/2026 are licensed under the MIT License, while commits to Temper and
after 14/02/2026 are licensed under the GPL-3.0. This is not a dual license, rather a change in license that occurred at
a specific point in time.
